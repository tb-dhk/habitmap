# intro
welcome to habitmap!

see the habitmap documentation [here](https://shuu-wasseo.github.io/habitmap-docs/index.html).

habitmap is a command-line app to track your habits and visualise how committed you are to making or maintaining them with colorful heatmaps!

habitmap allows you to:
- add and remove habits
- track your habits
- customise how many steps each habit has (see the explanation on steps [here](commands/habit.md/#steps))
- print out several types of heatmaps based on each habit
- customise the colors in the heatmaps + make your own aliases for the colors!
